## Synergy
Introducing Synergy - a discord chatbot built using the OpenAI API

With it, you can:

- View every response in context, so you won't lose track of the conversation even if multiple users chat
- Export the latest chat history with one command
- Set up the bot easily with just two simple commands
- Enjoy seamless updates â€“ we're constantly improving the bot
- And best of all, it's free!

Please note that this project is in active development, so there may be unknown bugs.
